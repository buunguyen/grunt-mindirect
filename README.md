# grunt-mindirect
[Grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) [multi-task](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/types_of_tasks.md) for minifying JS files and overwriting them with minified contents.

This is different from the [built-in min task](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/task_min.md) which creates one single output with concatenated minified contents).

This task is typically used together with [grunt-contrib-copy](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-copy/) task.

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install grunt-mindirect`

Then load it from your `grunt.js` file:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-mindirect');
```

In your `grunt.js` file, add something like below:

```js
mindirect: {
	dist: ['dist/libs/editor.js', 'dist/scripts/*.js']
}
```

After the task is run, all matched files will have their contents minified.
